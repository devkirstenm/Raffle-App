## ChatGPT Prompts ü§ñ
Using conversational prompts

### Prompt 1
Hey there! I've got this exciting idea to create a dog raffle web app. I'm considering using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this.

I envision a form where users can enter their names to participate, which will be stored on a participant list. Once we have all the participants, there should be a 'Draw' button that, when clicked, picks a random winner from the pool. 

Please outline the basic steps to get started.

### Prompt 2
Wonderful! Please generate the project code using your outline. 

Divide the interface into different sections: a header, a container holding an entry form, a participants list, a winner display area, and a "Draw" button.

Clicking the "draw" button should display the winner's name with a dog and gift emoji. Use a vibrant color scheme such as `#ff4081` for the header background color and complementary colors for the button states. 

I want you to make the CSS and JavaScript code easy to understand, even for non-coders. Remember to add code comments above each CSS rule and each line of JavaScript.

### Prompt 3
Please use Google Material Icons to add a dog icon inside the h1.
